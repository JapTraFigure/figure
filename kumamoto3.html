  <meta name="description" content="Why did we decide to produce Kumamoto Castle this time? It is because I was so moved by the actual Kumamoto Castle.vThe other day, I had some free time after a long absence, so I went on a trip to Kumamoto and other parts of Kyushu. My first goal was to go boating in Takachiho Gorge! I will think about the extra time after that when I get there. However, at first I only had an image of Kyushu as the sand bath in Ibusuki and Sakurajima, which I visited with my father when I was in elementary school.... This time, I relied on a map and went as far as time would allow to visit the places that inspired me. As a result, I was able to experience a very fulfilling "trip" and had a meaningful time, but my visit was after the Kumamoto earthquake. There were still scars from the earthquake, and collapsed houses and apartments whose entire ground floor had been destroyed appeared before my eyes at times. What is the meaning of the earthquake? I had a chance to feel and think about it firsthand. In that sense, it was a valuable time for me. And then I saw Kumamoto Castle...I thought, Let's build it!">

      <h1 class="repair_taital">Doyusha's 1/350 scale Kumamoto Castle [3/7]</h1>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_01.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">A veranda (watchtower?) is attached to the third level of the Udo turret. The only problem is that each of the four sides is made up of different parts, so it is very difficult to match them. However, it is also difficult to match the four sides because each side is divided into different parts... Considering painting, I wanted to be able to remove the parts (so-called "post-framing"), so I first assembled the three parts in a U-shape and shaped them.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Also, the edge where it meets the railing was thick, so I shaved it off with a knife to make it look thinner.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Now, after the shaping is done, let's try to align the three sides of the U-shape with the remaining one side....<br>Hmmm, there is a gap....<br>This is a little tight!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">So, I gave up on the post-fabrication here once and for all.First of all, I cut off the handrail part because it was in the way of shaping (I went to the trouble of making the edges thinner...), and then I filled in the gap at the corner of the balcony. After that, I painted it with a base color because I didn't want to leave any paint residue, and then I restored the railing with etched parts for ship models. Since this Kumamoto Castle is in 1/350 scale, I searched for parts for ship models in the same scale and found a variety of parts that would be just right. The simple shape is a good practice for using etched parts for the handrail.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">There was one more thing I was wondering about. It was the pull-up door (what is it called?) that is molded into the wall of the building. I was also concerned about one more thing: the raised doors molded on the walls of the building. The carving was not very well done and the edges were not sharp, so it did not look like a door at all. I wanted to do something about this, but there were so many of them that it would be difficult to carve evenly.... Then, I came up with the idea of attaching plastic plates to the edges. I put up plastic boards of even size, shifting them slightly to reproduce the gap between the doors. Then, by pasting plastic boards of slightly larger sizes, the space inside the door was also expressed. However, when we actually tried this, we found that there were so many of them that it took a lot of patience.... Moreover, if the edges of the plastic boards were not aligned or if they were glued crookedly, the appearance would deteriorate at once, so it was nerve-wracking.... I think it was effective, but I was exhausted by the time I finished.... (The area indicated by the red arrow in the image is before processing.)<br><br><br>At the same time, we decided to finish the base for display. I had the base parts, but it looked too shabby on its own, so I decided to display it on a wooden panel. A4 is a good size.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">First, the surface is prepared with 320 to 600-grit sandpaper, and then colored oil for wood is applied.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The color oil is mahogany. It is not too flashy, but it does not look too blended and buried. Paint used on wood tends to require a longer drying time than paint for models, so it is recommended to do this as soon as possible.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">We decided to use screws to hold the base and wooden base firmly in place.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">However, it is difficult to find a place to put the screws.... Even if I use the longest screws I have on hand, I can't seem to get them into the back side of the building where they won't be seen. Well, it's too much trouble to go out and buy screws now...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Since we had no choice, we decided to make our own board to fix the nuts and fix them firmly. After this, the display base will be finished by applying a glossy varnish.</p>
