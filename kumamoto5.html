  <meta name="description" content="Why did we decide to produce Kumamoto Castle this time? It is because I was so moved by the actual Kumamoto Castle.vThe other day, I had some free time after a long absence, so I went on a trip to Kumamoto and other parts of Kyushu. My first goal was to go boating in Takachiho Gorge! I will think about the extra time after that when I get there. However, at first I only had an image of Kyushu as the sand bath in Ibusuki and Sakurajima, which I visited with my father when I was in elementary school.... This time, I relied on a map and went as far as time would allow to visit the places that inspired me. As a result, I was able to experience a very fulfilling "trip" and had a meaningful time, but my visit was after the Kumamoto earthquake. There were still scars from the earthquake, and collapsed houses and apartments whose entire ground floor had been destroyed appeared before my eyes at times. What is the meaning of the earthquake? I had a chance to feel and think about it firsthand. In that sense, it was a valuable time for me. And then I saw Kumamoto Castle...I thought, Let's build it!">

      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">From here, we are ready for a fresh start and the creation of a scene! But first...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The itabori, as it is in the kit, is a butt joint. Since it is expected to come off with a high probability, we reinforced it with brass wire. If these parts come off later in the work, it may lower the motivation. The kit is designed to reproduce trees using plastic parts and urethane (sponge), but I decided to use external parts to make it easier. And it looks more realistic this way...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This is what we used. The scale is about 1/150, which is more than twice the size of Kumamoto Castle, which is 1/350. However, there are several variations of this product in different sizes, and when I used the smaller one, I did not feel that much discomfort.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Pre-drill holes where the tree will be planted. The foundation parts had instructions with round molds where to plant trees, but I rearranged them somewhat, being conscious of coarseness, density and balance. I planted the trees while thinking that if the trees were under the stone wall, they would be used to move to higher ground during an attack, which would put the defenders at a disadvantage. However, in the image above, the tree is planted under the stone wall.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Since it was difficult to adjust the angle by simply drilling a hole in the base part, we added a support on the back side. It is a simple thing, but by fixing the tree in two places, it becomes easier to make it vertical. Incidentally, we have not glued the tree yet because we anticipated that it would be inconvenient to handle it in the future. We will leave it only for preparation.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Also, the wood used in this project was basically painted, but there were some areas, mainly on the trunk, where the paint was not applied. The color of the base material itself was visible, so I used a brownish paint to touch it up. However, the paint was very deep and difficult to apply....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Just as I was thinking that it was time to start painting the stone walls, I found a paint that looked just right, so I immediately purchased it. The paint is made in Italy and its name is Stone Gray Set! It was a set of 6 subtly different grays for cobblestones and stone moats.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">For the base color, I used the gray surfacer ground as it is. The rest was painted using the paints included in the aforementioned set, while considering coarseness, density, and balance. However, the solid paint is too bright and I can't shake off the impression that the paint is too blurred....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">So, first of all, I washed it with a dark brown smear paint to reproduce dust and mud stains. However, this makes it look like it was just left there and dirty without proper management...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I filtered the image several times with a diluted dark sea gray, partly as a tonal adjustment.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Finally, I added dirt and mud stains, mainly on the lower part of the stone wall, using Mr. Weathering Color: Grand Brown. I feel that the above work softened the different grays and made them feel a little more realistic. By the way, it is said that Kiyomasa Kato, who built Kumamoto Castle, prepared as many as 120 wells in the castle in case of a siege. One of these wells is located on a part of the foundation.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_12.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I can see the other side through the tube.... I didn't want to neglect the well that Lord Kiyomasa considered so important....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto5_13.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I decided to make parts to reproduce the water surface and apply them from the back side. After painting the water surface blue, I applied Gaianotes: UV Gel Clear (UV curable clear resin) to reproduce it. Although I feel that the blue is a little too bright, I chose this color to make it easy to recognize and assert that it is water since it is located in a secluded area.</p>
