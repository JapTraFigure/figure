  <meta name="description" content="I would like to not only build a plastic model of Azuchi Castle but also give it an original paint job to make it look cool. Azuchi Castle is a castle ruin located in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. The castle was built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi on a flat site, which was unusual for a castle with a castle tower. Today, the castle is designated as a special national historic site and attracts many tourists. Oda Nobunaga also built a fort here before Azuchi Castle. He was a military commander of the Warring States period, based in Owari Province (present-day Aichi Prefecture). Nobunaga was victorious in numerous battles and aimed to unify the country, but was conspired to death by his own vassals in 1582.">
