  <meta name="description" content="Why did we decide to produce Kumamoto Castle this time? It is because I was so moved by the actual Kumamoto Castle.vThe other day, I had some free time after a long absence, so I went on a trip to Kumamoto and other parts of Kyushu. My first goal was to go boating in Takachiho Gorge! I will think about the extra time after that when I get there. However, at first I only had an image of Kyushu as the sand bath in Ibusuki and Sakurajima, which I visited with my father when I was in elementary school.... This time, I relied on a map and went as far as time would allow to visit the places that inspired me. As a result, I was able to experience a very fulfilling "trip" and had a meaningful time, but my visit was after the Kumamoto earthquake. There were still scars from the earthquake, and collapsed houses and apartments whose entire ground floor had been destroyed appeared before my eyes at times. What is the meaning of the earthquake? I had a chance to feel and think about it firsthand. In that sense, it was a valuable time for me. And then I saw Kumamoto Castle...I thought, Let's build it!">
