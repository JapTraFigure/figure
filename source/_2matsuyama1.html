  <meta name="description" content="Matsuyama Castle is located in Matsuyama City, Ehime Prefecture, and is one of the 100 most famous castles in Japan. The castle was built in 1602, and the present keep was restored in 1988. The castle is also home to a historical museum and an art museum, and is a favorite destination for many tourists. The area around the castle is also known for its cherry blossoms, which attract many cherry blossom-viewing visitors in spring. This time, I would like to create this Matsuyama Castle to my own taste.">
