      <p class="repair_text">Masking tape was applied to cover the stone wall.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This is what it looks like in close-up. Unlike the world where even a 0.1mm mistake is not allowed when making a plastic model of a car, making a model of a castle is relatively easy because it can be done roughly.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Finally, it is time to paint the ground.Paint the ground with a fluffy coat of dark yellow. No solid paint.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Then paint with tan. This is also sprayed fluffy.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Fun masking tape peeling.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The "first stage" of painting of stone walls and ground was completed.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The corner of the stone wall is failing. It needs to be corrected. Painting the keep.
Painting the keep of Nobunaga Oda, the High King, is a fun part of the project.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The painting of Azuchi Castle is a matter of personal preference, as there are only a few surviving documents of the castle. The Azuchi Castle that I will build will be a symbol of the new age of military rule under the heaven. I aim to create a "gorgeous and gorgeous" castle. The top floor of the castle tower will be painted in gold, as if it were covered with gold leaf.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The parapet of the keep will also be painted gold.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The nameplate of Azuchi Castle will also be painted gold.<br><br><br><br>The roof tiles will be painted.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The tiles will be painted in neutral gray.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_12.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The eave area will be painted white.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_13.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Mark the roof tile area. Apply a coat of thinned flat black.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_14.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Wipe with solvent to complete inking.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_15.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The lower part of the keep should be painted with Super Italian Red 2 because we want it to be crimson.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_16.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Remove the masking.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_17.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">It is going to be a flashy keep. The interior is also painted in gold to resemble a gold leaf covering.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi3_18.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The orca is also painted gold and temporarily assembled. I will look at it carefully and confirm the image. I would like to paint more details with a brush in the future.</p>
