      <p class="repair_text">At last, Azuchi Castle is completed!<br><br><br><br>The photo was taken outdoors in natural light. The camera is a smartphone. What do you think?　Doesn't it look like a real castle? Making a model is fun, but photographing it to make it look real is also fun. I think Azuchi Castle in the sunlight is very beautiful. The following images were taken indoors.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi6_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The castle tower glows in the sunlight. The background is a printout of the sky image on A3 size copy paper.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">Although it looks large, the size is 175 mm (length) x 115 mm (width) x 110 mm (height).</p>

      <p class="repair_text">It was difficult to write in the window area with a faceted brush.</p>

      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/azuchi6_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">How was it? I think the castle has an air befitting the residence of Nobunaga Oda, the Sixth Heavenly Demon King. There is no "what if" in history, but if Oda Nobunaga had lived, Japan would be different from what it is today.</p>
