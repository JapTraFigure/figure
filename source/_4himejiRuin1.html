      <p class="repair_text">We will build the abandoned Himeji Castle after the abolition of the domain.<br><br>The kit to be used is a 1/500 scale kit from Fujimi. It is a re-released version of the one formerly released by Kawai Shokai.<br><br>There are several available in this scale. Comparison of the bases.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">The largest one on the left is Doyusha's Premium Himeji Castle. It is the newest one as a kit. The base shows particular attention to detail and seems to reproduce the ground of the current Himeji Castle quite faithfully, including the cobblestone pavement. The upper right is Fujimi's one used in this project. The lower right is the standard version by Doyusha. The deformation is quite severe, such as in the Bizen-maru. The mold of the stone wall is the most detailed in Fujimi's version and fits the sense of scale.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">Incidentally, the premium Himeji Castle.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">The stones are a little larger. However, the way they are piled up gives a good atmosphere. The Fujimi model is too neatly broken up and too cohesive. The stone steps at the leno gate are also very detailed in Premium Himeji Castle. Below is Fujimi.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">This time, since we are adding an additional ring, we dared to use a clean Fujimi. The core is made of styrofoam and other materials.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin1_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Surround the stone wall with plastic plates.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin1_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Put Tamiya putty on the surface and carve the stone wall</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin1_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I emphasized the height a little. Because of this, there are places where things don't add up. Like the depth of the Mikuni moat. Unlike the old photo reproduction of Kumamoto Castle, I did not faithfully reproduce the old photo. The images are Castle Laputa in the Sky and Gunkanjima. It will be a semi-creative work. The stone walls of Yamasanomaru are also going to be quite covered with moss and ivy, so the stone walls are sparsely carved.</p>
