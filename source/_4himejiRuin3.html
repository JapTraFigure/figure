      <p class="repair_text">Inspired by Himeji Castle on the verge of collapse before the Great Meiji Restoration, we are creating a ruined Himeji Castle. This is what it looks like now.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">There are quite a lot of scratches on the turrets, and for what it's worth, I used two standard Himeji Castle kits from Doyusha in addition to the Fujimi kit. For example, I cut up and used them like this.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The obi turret is a simple U-shaped plane, but the folded roof parts are surprisingly rare. Moreover, this left-handed bend is also missing! As a result, it looks like this...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Connect these together.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Give me a break. The white parts of the ridge tiles are cut out of a tile pattern and pasted together from both sides with plastic rods as the ridge. The roof of the obi-kaku turret on the left is also made by connecting a number of them together. This kind of work was repeated to make these turrets of the Bizen Maru.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Only the facing area has not been painted or damaged yet, so it is unusually clean. The damage expression also needs a lot of work.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Although it is difficult to see, the carving of the roof tiles, the unevenness of the eave tiles, and the damage to the rafters are all sculpted by filing. The falling roof tiles are also expressed at the same time. After this, the roof tiles will be smudged and painted in multiple colors to represent the grass growing from the roof.</p>

      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">A true ruin! Such a beautiful keep...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Dong.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/himejiRuin3_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">There are still trees, so it will be a dense landscape. The work is quite difficult, but I wanted to ruin various castles. I want to submerge them in water and so on. Maybe I should become a castle ruin modeler.</p>
