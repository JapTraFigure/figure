      <p class="repair_text">This time, This is a full view diorama of "1/150 Horyuji Seiin Garan".<br><br> I had previously obtained an unassembled junk kit with missing or damaged parts. I would like to use it as a material for this project. I would like to use it as a material this time.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">This still cost over $1,000, and a pedestal to put this on would need to be quite large.<br><br>The pedestal on which it would be placed would need to be quite large.<br><br><br><br>This time we have to go even bigger and get a pedestal of the 80cm x 70cm class, the largest ever.<br><br>It will probably cost 4-5000 yen.<br><br>Furthermore, the five-story pagoda and the main hall will be converted from Fujimi's kit, and the roof tiles will be converted from Fujimi's kit.<br><br>sheet, plantings, electric decoration, etc., it will be the most expensive diorama I have ever made. It will be the most expensive diorama so far.<br><br>
Now, I want to disassemble it as much as possible before painting and building, However, the adhesives are so tightly adhered that it is difficult to peel off.<br><br>I managed to remove the main auditorium and the central gate with synthetic adhesive, but the five-story pagoda and the main hall were not able to be removed because of the strong woodworking adhesive.<br><br>The five-story pagoda and the main gate were strong woodworking adhesives, and I had to soak them in hot water to soften them, pry them open with a flat-blade screwdriver, etc,<br><br>After three hours of hard struggle, I finally managed to remove them.<br><br>After 3 hours of struggling, it was finally removed. (The veneer of the pedestal was partially torn off.)</p>

      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran1_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">As with the Phoenix Hall, Fujimi and mold maker Osada are stamped on the back side of the base.<br><br>Was this a standard kit of this period?</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran1_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I always thought that Fujimi's logo looks like the old Toshiba.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">This is the Kondo Hall of Horyuji Temple.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran1_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This is a pillar with a dragon sculpture, but it was not there when the temple was built.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran1_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The base and wood parts are treated with weathering.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Here is a comparison: in 1/150 scale, the delicacy of the plastic kit prevails.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran1_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This Kondo was completed in only two days. Straight assembly of plastic kits is really easy.<br><br><br><br>Next is the five-story pagoda. This kit is so well made that I am in love with it. As expected of Fujimi!</p>

      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran1_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The wooden one is simplified, including the attic, and is not as good as the plastic kit.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran1_12.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This five-story pagoda is also completed in two days.<br><br>I am surprised at how easy it is to make a straight assembly, since I have been scratch building so much lately.<br><br>I was surprised at how easy it was to make a straight assembly.</p>
