      <h1 class="repair_taital">Horyu-ji Temple Saiin Garan,the Western Precinct, diorama [3/4]</h1>
      <p class="repair_text">Now, we will add electric lights.<br><br>This diorama is very large, so it is very difficult to install the LEDs one by one in the temple.It is very difficult to install LEDs one by one. I could have used tape LEDs as usual, but it would have been quite difficult because of the many curved lines. So, I decided to use illumination lights this time. This time, we decided to use illumination lights, which are used to wrap around Christmas trees and so on.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This is easy to place because it can be bent freely. Various types of LEDs are sold on Amazon.com, but most of them have 10cm LED spacing. LED spacing is 10cm. In dioramas, we use the type with 5cm LED spacing because it extends the length of the diorama. The following product is 1.2m long, has 24 LEDs, and comes with button batteries. It contains 10 of these and is extremely inexpensive.We recommend this product because it can be used for a variety of decorations and is very useful.<br><br><br><br>But I wonder if they can make a profit with 240 LEDs and 20 3V button batteries in the box. I wonder if there is any profit in this price.<br><br>The lead wires can be fixed quickly by gluing them together with a glue gun.<br><br>A glue gun and stick cost 300 yen (purchased at a 100 yen store). The glue gun alone used to cost about 800 yen. So, it is really a good time!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Now that the wiring is done, I turned it on under the lights.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">It is quite bright.<br><br>Turn off the lights and turn on.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">It is very atmospheric and great!<br><br>Next, sand was sprinkled on the ground and thinned wood bond was sprayed to fix it in place.<br><br>After sprinkling sand, the wiring and LEDs are no longer noticeable!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Trees are sprayed with diluted wood bond to Dutch dried flowers, Sprinkle with turf and voila!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Finally here it is: <br><br><br><br>The rest are the usual figures, but when I think of Horyuji Temple, I think of school excursions.<br><br>This time it is a mix of female students on a school excursion and ordinary people.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The schoolgirls are made by Tomytec and are generally chubby. Girls at this age eat a lot...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/horyujisaiingaran3_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The general public has painted the white type of plizer. This detail is wonderful at a height of just over 1cm. Especially, the expression of the face is excellent.　As expected of PLEASER! </p>
