      <p class="repair_text">Fujimi's 1/100 scale Kinkakuji Temple will be produced.
Plastic models of the Temple of the Golden Pavilion are available from other manufacturers, but this prize is more expensive and the finished product is more realistic.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku02.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">Looking at the contents of the kit, most of the parts are gold plated. I tried dipping them in bleach, but this plating does not come off. It takes a lot of effort to remove it with lacquer thinner, but when I tested the paint, I was able to paint it without any problem. Even without removing the plating from the painted surface, it can be glued with ordinary plastic model glue without any problem, so we will proceed with the production as it is.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku03.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">We will start from the base surface consisting of the pond and the foundation of the Kinkakuji Temple. Since there was a dent in the part of the pond, we filled it with putty and shaped the surface with a sandpaper so that it becomes an even surface.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku04.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">The pond area is sprayed with surfacer to create a smooth base surface.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku05.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">Paint is applied using Kreos lacquer-based paint. First paint the entire base in reddish brown, then paint the base of the Golden Pond in gray. The gray color is a mixture of Gull Gray, German Gray, and Flat White. It is a fairly light gray.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku06.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">Mask the foundation and the stones in the pond with masking sol. The darker parts are masked with Kreos Masking Sol Kai, which can be cut with a knife after drying. The light-colored part is masked with "Masking Sol neo" which cannot be cut but is easy to peel off.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku13.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">After the masking sol is dry, carefully cut and remove excess sol, and start painting. For the pond area, I would like to layer various colors to create depth of color. First, I created a base color with middle stone.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku07.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">Next, I layered a thin layer of dark green to bring out the color of the base.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku08.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">Finally, I layered a light gray-green color and coated it with clear can spray.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku09.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku12.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">The water did not look quite right just by spraying the clear, so I applied Tamiya acrylic clear with a brush. The slight shimmering of the water surface was reproduced and it looks like water surface. I will finish painting the details later, and next time, I will start the building itself.</p>
