      <h1 class="repair_taital">Fujimi's 1/100 scale Kinkakuji Temple [2/3]</h1>
      <p class="repair_text">In the second session of Kinkakuji, we will begin work on the building.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku15.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">The first layer of columns will be painted in reddish brown.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku10.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">The white wall parts are also primed with reddish brown once first. Plastic parts are more easily allowed to let light through than one might think. This primer is used to prevent "light transparency" of white parts and to prevent the lightness that is typical of plastic parts.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku11.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">Apply the main coat of flat white over the primer coat of red brown.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku16.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">The white wall is attached to the columns, but when the corners are assembled, some of the protrusions on the wall tend to interfere and create gaps, so a portion of the wall is cut as shown in the photo.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku17.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">The white wall is installed and the first layer is assembled. The contrast between the columns and the white wall is quite beautiful.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku18.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">The first layer has been assembled. Although some of the doors in this kit can be opened and closed, there is almost nothing inside, and it is pitch-dark, so opening and closing the doors does not seem to make much sense. I glued the doors firmly because it would be troublesome if the doors were to come off and fall into the building after completion.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku19.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">If the second or third layer of protrusions that secure the floor to the floor cause a gap between the floor and the wall, cut them off and flatten the area where the wall meets the floor with a file or paper so that there is no gap.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku20.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">After gluing it to the floor, fix it with masking tape or other means so that it adheres firmly to the floor.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku21.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">If you paint it gold, scratches and other defects will stand out, so spray lightly with surfacer and check the surface. I glued the front and back of the roof, but it became troublesome to paint. If you are going to build a new roof, it is easier to glue the front and back after painting.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku22.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">For the gold paint, I used regular gold from Kreos, not something special like Metal Color. I decided to paint the base with black first, because if I applied it directly on the surfacer base, the color would not come out well and the color would not have depth.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku23.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">Once the primer coat is dry, spray the gold with an airbrush. As you can see, a pretty good shine has been achieved.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku29.jpg"></div>

<p class="repair_text">The color of the roof looks quite bright and brownish in the picture on the package. However, when I saw the actual roof, I felt it was a darker, blackish color due to the rain. In order to make the color more vivid with the gold color of the walls, I mixed German gray with a little reddish brown and painted it a very blackish gray.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku28.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku27.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku24.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">This is how I painted the roof. Before gluing the front and back parts of the roof, I could have simply painted them gray and gold respectively, but since I glued them together, I used masking tape to paint them differently.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku25.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">I installed the third layer on the roof and it was a good decision to darken the roof color because of the contrast.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kinkaku26.jpg"></div>
<p class="repair_text">I assembled it temporarily. Next time, it will be completed.</p>
