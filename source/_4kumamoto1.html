      <p class="repair_text">This time, we will produce the DX version. It was easy to obtain. There was also a DX Gold version, but it seems that the parts of the building are gold plated. It seems that this is why the name "gold version" is given to it, and as far as I can see from the pictures on the Internet, it looks sparkling and gorgeous.
 However, that one was not the direction I was looking for, so I'll pass on it this time. Also, I guessed that there must be a standard version since it is called a DX version, but it seems that Kumamoto Castle is not included in the lineup.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">The base parts, including the stone walls, are included. It is huge. Naturally, the box is also large, so I was thinking of crushing it as soon as possible, but I may be able to use it to handle the powder used to reproduce the lawn. I will keep it for now.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">It is huge....</p>

      <p class="repair_text">There were also things like this in the box. It looks like color powder to reproduce lawn and urethane (sponge) to reproduce leaves of trees. The base is the most eye-catching part, but the rest of the parts are not so many with only 160 parts. Moreover, each part is molded in a total of four colors. As mentioned above, materials to reproduce grass and leaves are also included in the set, so I felt that a reasonable degree of completion could be obtained without painting.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">By the way, "Kumamoto Castle and the items related to Kiyomasa Kato and the Hosokawa family" was held at the Nihombashi Takashimaya Department Store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. I got this book there. And after reading this book, I found out that this kit seems to reproduce the area of the so-called Kumamoto Castle, including the main keep, the small keep, and the Udo turret.</p>
