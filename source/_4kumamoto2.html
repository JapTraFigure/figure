      <h1 class="repair_taital">Doyusha's 1/350 scale Kumamoto Castle [2/7]</h1>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Temporary Assembly and Shaping. Now it is time to start fabrication. First, I cut out the parts roughly and assembled them temporarily....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">It doesn't fit well... (-_-;) (-_-;)</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">When I checked the back of the parts, I found that the extrusion pins were sticking out and interfering with each other. Furthermore, we could see that the parting lines of some parts had large bumps. These seem to be interfering with the fit of the parts. I understood this within 5 minutes of starting to build this kit that I should not neglect the temporary assembly and shaping....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The main part of the building that hits the wall is the box assembly.<br><br>However...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Some parts may be deformed and need to be corrected each time. If these points are neglected, the building itself may become distorted.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The first layer (the lowest level) of the main and small keep is a complex shape, but it is also almost a box assembly.... Frankly speaking, it is very difficult.... <br>The upper part (roof) and the lower part (stone wall) were temporarily aligned many times while assembling.<br>Here, priority is given to the overall shape rather than the fit of the individual wall parts.<br>Otherwise, the castle would not fit the roof and stone wall parts, and it would not be built properly.<br>Incidentally, the space inside is reinforced with leftover runners.<br>There are almost no guides on the glued surfaces of the wall parts, so they are not strong enough. Therefore, we thought that the wall parts could easily be warped after being glued together.<br>Therefore, we reinforced the wall parts to make them as strong as possible.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">As expected, there was a gap on the adhesive surface at the corner where the parts fit together. It is easy to fill the gap with putty. I quickly filled the gap with putty!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">In order to construct the building without distortion, we thought it was important to make the right angle and level. We also glued square plastic rods to the inside of the glued surface to obtain right angles.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Also, when I aligned the first layer of the main keep and the small keep with the white attic parts, there was a gap, so I filled it in by attaching a plastic plate. If I leave it as it is, it will look like there is a hole in the wall, so I want to make sure I don't miss anything.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Some parts have guides for positioning, as shown by the arrows in the image. However, when I actually tried to align them, I got the impression that they were wobbly and not quite in the right position....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">In these areas, I cut away without using a guide by force. Then, using a square or similar tool, I would actually check the right angles while gluing.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">We further reinforced the inside with plastic material in pursuit of strength and right angles.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_12.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The image shows the roof part from the back, and some of the extruded pin marks can be seen in prominent positions. This is also a place that can be quickly filled in with putty! It may be surprisingly noticeable. Not only in this area, but also while repeating the temporary assembly, I took care not to forget to check for extrusion pin marks that would show up on the surface.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto2_13.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The image shows where the two attic parts (white parts) are sandwiched between the building parts, and the attic parts also serve as walls.<br>However, there is a gap between each of the attic parts...<br>As mentioned above, the attic also serves as a wall, so the gap would be noticeable....<br>We thought about gluing them together to eliminate the gap, but that would make it impossible to remove them, which would increase the difficulty of painting.<br>Therefore, I put a plastic plate on the surface where the attic parts meet to minimize the gap.</p>
