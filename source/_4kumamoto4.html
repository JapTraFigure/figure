      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Now that most of the shaping and processing is done, it is time to start painting.<br><br>We will start with the building walls.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_02.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">When I think of Kumamoto Castle, a black image first comes to mind, and I also think of it as having a noble and dignified atmosphere.<br><br>Therefore, I decided to use a clean finish without making it too dirty.<br><br>I used Gaianotes: Surfacer Evo Black as the base coat.<br><br>I used this as a base, and being conscious of the fact that the material is wood, I sprayed a thin coat of mahogany over the top to see how it would look.<br><br>We are conscious that the mahogany is only a hidden taste.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Once the paint was dry, I washed it with Mr. Weathering Color: Sandy Wash to give it a dirty and dusty look.<br><br>Not bad, but a little too dusty...<br><br>I will try to adjust it by spraying a thin layer of mahogany over the top again.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The attic is sprayed with Mr. Finishing Surfacer 1500 White and then inked with Tamiya's smear paint: dark brown.<br><br>The next step is the roof, and this is where I had the most trouble with the painting.<br><br>The roof is so small and there are so many tiles that masking is impractical.<br><br>Hmmm, what to do... (-_-;)<br><br>The first idea I came up with was to paint the plaster white first, and then drybrush the color of the roof tiles.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">First, I painted the roof white.<br><br>Then I applied the paint by rubbing it on with a brush in the manner of a dry brush....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Something about the gray and white border became gabby and soggy and very dirty....<br><br>This is not good...<br><br>Change of strategy!<br><br>Fortunately, the unevenness of the roof tiles and plaster is clear. So....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I sprayed the gray with an airbrush from a position close to horizontal to the roof so that the gray would be applied only to the convex part of the roof tile.<br><br>If the airbrush is positioned perpendicular to the roof, the gray will penetrate into the dents (plaster).<br><br>Be careful to keep the airbrush position horizontal to the roof as much as possible.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The result looks like this...<br><br>There is some blowout, but it looks like this can be fixed.<br><br>It might not be bad!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I corrected the spills by pouring a slightly thicker melted enamel flat white in the manner of a square insert.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">However, when I did so, I felt that the white was now too harsh.<br><br>I washed it with thinly melted Mr. Weathering Color: Grand Brown to reduce the brightness.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_12.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The roof on the left before washing and the roof on the right after washing.<br><br>After washing, the white color has calmed down and the roof looks weathered from exposure to the elements.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_13.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The nameplate was included in the kit and looked cool, so I decided to use it as is.<br><br>I painted it gold to accentuate the color.<br><br>The painting process is now in its final stage.<br><br>The painted parts are being assembled, but there is a little pitfall....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_14.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_15.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The gables were assembled by sliding them in from the backside of the roof, but the plastic plate that reproduced a pull-up door got caught in several places and would not fit....<br><br>The plastic plate that reproduced a pull-up door got stuck in several places.<br><br>In the end, we managed to get it in by cutting off the back side of the roof and other parts that might be hidden....<br><br>It seems that temporary assembly after processing is also important....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_16.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The gable ends are almost completely hidden in the area shown in the image, so the additional work is completely meaningless....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_17.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">By the way, the main keep and the small keep have open windows so that the inside can be seen, but if they are left as they are, the inside structure is completely visible through the tube....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_18.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Therefore, we decided to make a tatami mat out of plastic board and cover it with a lid so that the inside cannot be seen.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_19.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This is what it looked like when we put the roof over it.<br><br>It looks good.<br><br>By the way, I had some doubts, so I did some research and learned that there are two different ways to lay out tatami.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto3_20.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I read in the materials that the Kumamoto Castle was built in such a way that it seemed to be a non-faithful place to lay a ceremonial mat.<br><br>I tried to make it that way, but it was just a simple plastic board with lines dug out of it.<br><br>The word "fukushugi" sounds like a bad omen, but it is still used in temples and Japanese-style halls today.</p>
