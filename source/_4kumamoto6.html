      <p class="repair_text">Continuation and finishing of the scene (diorama) production</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">After painting most of the stone walls, we will build up the ground.<br><br>For the exposed soil, I used Tamiya Scenic Texture Paint: Dirt Dark Earth.<br><br>This has a nice texture and color tone!<br><br>The texture and color of the soil looked great, and the crumbly texture of the soil didn't feel too strange, so I'll just go ahead with the project.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I used Tamiya Scenic Texture Paint: Road Surface Light Gray for the graveled areas, but it looks awfully white.... (the area indicated by the arrow in the image)<br><br>I used it without stirring.<br><br>It looks like snow is piled up on the ground, so I used Tamiya Scene Texture Paint: Dark Gray for the road surface to correct it.<br><br>Also, I noticed that there is a passage to the left when you go up the stairs, but it dead-ends at the end of the passage....<br><br>It feels very strange to me....<br><br>Maybe my interpretation is wrong, but it would be very difficult to correct it at this stage, so I decided not to look here.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">For the garden area, I used Tamiya Scenic Texture Paint: Sand Light Sand.<br><br>This one has finer particles than the earth dark earth, which was perfect for the situation I was aiming for.<br><br>However, I felt the color was a little too bright, so I washed it down with Mr. Weathering Color: Grand Brown, which I diluted to a crisp to calm it down.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">After finishing the ground, I used the paints in AK interactive: DECAY ABANDONED WEATHERING SET to express weeds and mosses, mainly in areas like between the soil and the stone walls.<br><br>These paints are also made by a foreign manufacturer and are very useful, but they are a bit expensive and hard to find....<br><br>However, it was fun to try different kinds of paints this time.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Turf for model trains was used to recreate the lawn.<br><br>The powder included in the kit would have been fine, but the amount was too small and I was not sure if it would be enough, so I used the turf I had prepared in advance.<br><br>However, this one has slightly larger fibers and I felt it might spoil the scale.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Compared to the above turf, the one in the kit has smaller fibers, which is probably quite good....<br><br>Also, it is important to note that the kit provides two colors of powder.<br><br>Incidentally, the instructions for Kumamoto Castle instruct you to sprinkle the powder on the ground before the paint dries to fix it in place.<br><br>However, that leaves some uncertainty about fixing it in place, so here I used matte medium dissolved in water to fix it in place.<br><br>I found it easier to control the turf by applying the water-dissolved matte medium to the area where I wanted to plant the turf in advance and sprinkling the turf on top of the matte medium.<br><br>I felt that if I only planted trees and turf, the height would be extreme and unbalanced, so I decided to plant low trees as well.<br><br>First of all, I will place a richen for model trains....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Hmmm, what is it, but to me it looks like a monster summoned from another world suddenly appeared....<br><br>It's kind of creepy, so I rejected this one....</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The next one I used was called foliage, also sold for model trains, which is a sponge material attached to a net-like fiber.<br><br>Yes, this one is definitely better...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/kumamoto6_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Finally, I planted a tree, but I thought it would be unnatural for it to grow suddenly out of the ground, so I sprinkled Forridge's sponge around the base of the tree.</p>
