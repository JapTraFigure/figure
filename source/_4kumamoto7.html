      <p class="repair_text">The actual production period for this work was 21 days, or about 61 hours. (about 2.9 hours per day).<br><br>The kit I built this time is one of the oldest and most experienced plastic model kits I have ever built, in other words, it is a kit that has been around for a long time.<br><br>Looking back on it, I was impressed by the basic work such as deburring, processing of extruded pin marks, and checking and correcting the alignment of the parts.<br><br>However, it is easy to imagine that if the horizontal and vertical surfaces of a building are not properly assembled, distortions will occur and the building will instantly look bad.<br><br>I feel like I write this all the time, but I was reminded once again of the importance of basic construction.<br><br>I enjoyed working on the diorama.<br><br>It was a pleasant experience to see the scenery being reduced little by little on my desk.<br><br>Now that I have the materials, I am thinking of making another scene.<br><br>However, I think it is actually important that kits like this Kumamoto Castle, which give a sense of Japanese history, are relatively easy to obtain....<br><br>Because I was able to study history through the actual production.<br><br>I learned for the first time that the main and small keep were burnt down during the Civil War, and that what we have now was restored after the war in the Showa era.<br><br>On the other hand, I learned that the Udo turret was a building that had existed since the Edo period, which made it even more shocking that it was damaged in the earthquake....<br><br>I wonder if it is not a bad thing to deepen one's knowledge by using plastic models as a starting point.<br><br>(Although it may be a rare case that a plastic model was the trigger.... )<br><br>It is said that it will take 10 years to restore Kumamoto Castle.<br><br>I have gained new knowledge about Kumamoto Castle through this project, and I am even more interested in the castle.<br><br>I would like to visit the site again with the knowledge I gained this time, hoping to see its greatness again.</p>
