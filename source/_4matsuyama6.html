      <p class="repair_text">It was very difficult to paint the stone walls one by one.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/matsuyama6_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I was also particular about painting the white walls and boarded areas.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">The symbol of Matsuyama City, Ehime Prefecture</p>

      <p class="repair_text">The size is about this big. I did not use turf powder, which is a common ingredient in plastic model castles, this time. I did not use it this time because I did not think the amount of turf powder was enough and the single-color powder would make the model look like a toy. If you can use a variety of powders, it is possible.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">How was it? Anyway, the parts are small and don't fit well, so it was a lot of hard work. There are many tricks to building an architectural model that are not found in car models. I think that if you dig out the lines in the stone wall, you can make it look more three-dimensional. I would also like to plant small trees.<br>The finished product stands out in the room. It has too much presence. 
I recommend the "Plastic model of a castle" full of historical romance.</p>
