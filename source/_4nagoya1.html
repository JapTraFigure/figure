      <p class="repair_text">This picture was taken in the summer, but the real thing looks like this. It is a beautiful castle that I have been familiar with since I was a child.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya1_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">There are only a few parts to assemble the kit, so there are no particularly difficult parts. In order to minimize the time and effort required for masking, first assemble only the walls without gluing the roof parts and let the glue dry. If you have a cutting mat, you can adjust it so that the walls are at right angles to each other.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya1_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The second and first stories of the main keep are divided without gluing this part because the parts of the roof will not fit if the walls are assembled first.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya1_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">When the glue is dry, clean and shape the matching surfaces of the wall. The nail polisher in the photo is a women's nail polish.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya1_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This kit was released a long time ago, so the parts do not always fit perfectly without doing anything, as is the case with more recent kits. First of all, there are some "burrs" in the area circled in red. These burrs are often seen on old molds, and they are caused by the deterioration of the mold, which results in gaps in the joints, and the plastic material flows in between the gaps. Of course, these burrs need to be scraped off.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya1_07.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya1_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">This part is called a staggered gable, and it must be adjusted by shaving a little on the inside while removing burrs, or gaps will form. Adjust the parts temporarily assembling them several times to make sure not to cut too much.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya1_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Considering the time and effort required for masking, we would have liked to adhere the staggered gables after painting, but it was better to adhere them firmly to the roof parts before painting to avoid any gaps.</p>
