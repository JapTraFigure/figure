      <h1 class="repair_taital">Doyusha's 1/350 scale Nagoya Castle [3/6]</h1>
      <p class="repair_text">Today, I went to see the real thing in the middle of painting. The color of the roof looked quite different depending on the angle of view. I think it is better to see a picture of the actual object to get a better idea of how the color will look.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Part No. 39 is the wall of the corridor connecting the two keep towers. This part is not hidden by the roof and will be visible after completion, so it should be scraped clean with a knife. After that, primer the wall with German Gray as the other walls.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Tamiya acrylic flat white was used to paint the walls. Mask the inside to prevent paint from spraying through the windows. I used disposable chopsticks covered with double-sided tape as a handle to paint. I sprayed a thin coat of white on the top part of the roof, which is in the shadow of the roof, so that a little of the base color would remain.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The back part of the roof is white and should be painted together at this time.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The staggered gables of the small castle tower are also white and should be painted at the same time.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The staggered gables on the main keep were sprayed with a spray can of German gray, which was used for the primer.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Prepare for roof painting by masking off the staggered gables. Press down firmly with a toothpick to prevent paint from getting in.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The color of the roof of Nagoya Castle was mixed in the ratio of 6.5 Tamiya Acrylic Flat White, 0.5 Lett Brown, 2 Green, and 1 Blue. I did not measure and mix the colors, so it was just a sensory ratio, but it turned out to be almost exactly the color I imagined. The back side is not masked because masking is troublesome. If the color is covered, I will correct it later with a brush. The bottom roof of the main keep is the same gray color as the small keep, so be careful not to paint it.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The roofs of the small keep and other structures were painted with Tamiya acrylic XF-66 light gray.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The edge of the roof is repaired with a brush.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Apply Tamiya Enamel Flat Black thinned with solvent to suppress the color so that it does not become too bright. This time, I took care not to make it too black by thinning it further with solvent.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Wipe off any blackened areas due to solvent buildup with tissue paper.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_12.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Glue the roof and walls together. The roof of my kit was deformed, leaving a large gap, so I used clamps from a 100 yen store to firmly adhere and glue them together.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya3_13.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Finally, a castle-like shape has been created.</p>
