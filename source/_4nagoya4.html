      <h1 class="repair_taital">Doyusha's 1/350 scale Nagoya Castle [4/6]</h1>
      <p class="repair_text">This is the painting of the stone walls. The stone walls are an essential part of the castle, so this painting will have a great impact on the finished product. We want to make the stone walls look realistic and heavy.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">First, mask the edges of the diorama base to prevent paint from getting on it, then paint the stone walls with Tamiya acrylics in medium gray.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">After the base color has dried, blend the paint firmly into the grooves of the stone wall using the washing method described for the roof section. Paint the stone walls with Tamiya Enamel Flat Black diluted with solvent. As you can see in the photo, the paint is much thicker than the previous roof.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">It does not matter if the paint turns a little black, so make sure to leave the paint firmly in the grooves. After painting is completed, allow the paint to dry thoroughly for about one day.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_04.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The stone walls will be painted using a painting method called dry brush. Before painting the stone wall, rub the paint on the brush with a cloth or tissue paper to create a lighter color by mixing a medium gray with some flat white. Move the brush as if rubbing with a half-dried brush to bring out the carvings on the stone wall. A wide, soft bristle brush is suitable for painting large areas like this one, but it is best not to use a very expensive one because it will damage the brush.</p>
      <p class="repair_text">It is difficult to explain in words, so we have prepared a video. Can you see how the dry brush has created a three-dimensional effect?</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The stone wall was completed like this. I think this is enough to give the impression of a stone wall, so if you are satisfied with this, I think it is fine to complete. However, I would like to try one more step. Why don't you give it a try if you have the energy?</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">As you can clearly see from the picture on the package, the stones on the stone wall are not all the same color, but each one is a slightly different color.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I would like to represent the colors of this stone. Various colors can be created using acrylic paints in white, black, raw umber, raw sienna, Prussian blue, and olive green. Many acrylic paints are cheap and easily available, so you can mix five colors (brown, dark blue, ochre, white, and black) to create a variety of colors. Watercolors can also be used since the base colors are acrylic paints.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">It is not necessary to go that far because it would be a daunting task to paint each and every stone wall. Place colors randomly in a few places at a time, using different colors such as dark, light, brown, and bluish gray. Dilute the paint with enough water and apply it in a natural way, changing the color tone slightly so that it does not float with the surrounding colors.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya4_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The stone wall is finished. To be continued in the next issue.</p>
