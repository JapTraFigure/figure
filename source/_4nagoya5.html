      <p class="repair_text">First, we prepared Tomix color powder. I used two colors, brown and light brown, and a little green color powder included in the kit. Then, I used Koeido's Sand Powder to represent gravel on the ground. There seem to be various types of sand powder, but the product used this time is SA-23. Both color powder and sand powder are sold for less than 200 yen and can be easily purchased.<br><br>The kit also includes a sticker called a "water surface sheet" to represent the water in the inner moat. However, I read in a local newspaper some time ago that there is a theory that water was never stored in the inner moat of Nagoya Castle, and this theory is now said to be correct. Therefore, we decided not to represent water in the inner moat this time, but to use colored powder as the ground.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">To glue the color powder and sanding powder, use wood bond dissolved in water, which is often sold at 100 yen stores, to fill the bottom of the mini cups to about 1 mm thickness. The Tamiya acrylic bottle is placed to show the size of the prepared mini cups, and the white paint has nothing to do with it.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Add about 1 cm of water from the bottom of the cup and mix the bond well. The ratio of water to water is explained in this way so that you can understand the ratio of bond to diluted water, but there is no need to be too nervous about this ratio. It can be done even if the ratio is not too high.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The area under the stone wall is masked to prevent bond from sticking. In this photo, the raised area where the tree is planted is covered with a coat of water-soluble wood glue with a brush.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Sprinkle brown color powder.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Place a brush with bond on top of the powder and allow the bond to penetrate the powder. The powder will stick to the brush and peel off, so sprinkle the powder over the powder again, and repeat the process of penetrating the bond with the brush two or three times to make the powder thicker.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">It now looks like this. Uneven thickness should be evened out with a finger.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The kit contains dark green and light green colored powders, but we will use the light colored powder. The powder is sprinkled on the surface and fixed with bond. This will be used to represent the grassy ground of the planted area.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The inner moat is light brown colored powder.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Adhesion of sand powder is done in the same way as for colored powder.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Allow it to dry thoroughly overnight before removing the masking tape.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/nagoya5_12.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I tried to reproduce the difference in texture between the gravel pavement and the ground with trees growing on it. How do you think it turned out? Next time, it will be completed.</p>
