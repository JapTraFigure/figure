      <p class="repair_text">This is the kit used in this project. I will make it as soon as possible.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka1_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The parts look like this. Each layer of the roof is formed in one piece. Therefore, the number of parts itself is not large. However, the mold seems to be bad, and it seems to take a lot of time and effort for shaping and groundwork.<br><br>Let's read the instruction manual. This manual is very unusual. I would like to introduce it a little. This may be the first time to explain the instruction manual on a plastic modeling blog!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka1_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Before you start crafting 4) Use a small amount of glue because it is aqueous. That's the secret to beautifully finished work.<br><br>I know...right? It's something different, isn't it? The wording is like a question to someone, as well as a typo. Let's look at it a little more.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">Painting a plastic model gives it a more realistic appearance, and it is fun to paint it.<br><br>Here is a description of how to color-code this castle.<br><br>Please comment. I can't keep going on and on. I've recommended color-coding so much, but I'm just going to write it down.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka1_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Other times, they would tell us to assemble the parts according to the drawings, but ignore the order of assembly and put the or or orachi at the end of the drawings.<br><br>Then, why don't you just write that on the drawings?</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka1_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The reason I mentioned earlier that it would take a lot of time and effort to shape, for example, these ejection marks. I don't know what to do with all these intricate, one-piece molding, and all these entry corners...</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka1_07.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">And the marks are well "described" in the manual. I am convinced. The preface seems to be for beginners.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka1_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I put putty for now.<br><br>How do you guys file such an entry corner?<br><br>Please tell me. Thank you very much.</p>
