      <p class="repair_text">First, I sprayed a quick coat of base gray. As you can clearly see when I put the color on like this, the kit as is is more of a stone siding than a stone wall. This is probably due to the shallow grooves and the flat smooth surface.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka2_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Incidentally, as you can see, the injection marks were cleaned up by sanding, which I learned from an acquaintance.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka2_03.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Now, what shall I do for the stone wall reality?<br><br>Do I re-carve it with a router?<br><br>I thought it would be a lot of work, but I started carving with love.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka2_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Naturally, details of the stone wall appear not only on the outside but also on the inside, so we will re-carve these as well.<br><br>The omitted details were also carved at this time.<br><br>The stonewalls are piled up on the ground, based on the chronology, background, documents, and excavation conditions up to the present day. The stonewalls are completely different from those of today's Osaka Castle, so I will try to faithfully reproduce them.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka2_05.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">So it took me a few days just to carve it. The router is heaving with heat. This is the south side.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/osaka2_06.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Here is the north side. I will spray the base gray one more time, check the details again, and if it is OK, I will put the color on.</p>
