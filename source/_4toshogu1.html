      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_01.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I took on the arduous task of painting the sculpture of Yomeimon Gate of Nikko Toshogu Shrine in 1/80 scale, which could be described as a painstaking task.<br><br>I felt exhausted even after all these years!<br><br>The elaborateness of Fujimi Mokei's model of the gate is simply impressive, and it inspires me to paint it in a way that makes the most of this precision!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_02.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">When reproducing the gate, I referred to the catalogue published by Toshogu. It is the bible for the reproduction of the Yomeimon Gate in its most detailed colors, so much so that I do not think I would have been able to reproduce it in such detail without it.</p>

      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_04.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">We use pure gold leaf color paint from Shizen-do, a long-established gold leaf company in Kyoto, which we often use for gold coloring. It is a bit more expensive than ordinary paints, but I like it because the colors are so good that I think it is the best gold paint. When I introduced this paint, a professional model artist asked me, "Where can I buy it? I was asked by a professional modeler, "Where can I buy this paint?</p>

      <p class="repair_text">Reproduction of extremely colored sculptures requires a wide variety of colors, and almost all of the standard colors are used. After the base color is painted first, different colors are layered one on top of the other, and the process takes a lot of time because the colors must dry each time.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_08.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The plaster parts of the columns will be weathered and angled to bring out the carved patterns and give them a realistic look. This kind of work continues.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_09.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">So big that you wouldn't know if you didn't tell them it was a group of children.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_10.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">Even the smallest patterns are carefully colored in gold. Anyway, this kind of detailed work goes on and on. Sometimes I feel like painting with a big brush. The work was so detailed that my eyes would ache and my shoulders would stiffen, so I had to keep myself motivated by imagining what the finished product would look like when it was completed. This is the kind of work that can be considered mental training.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_11.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">I always get motivated when most of the parts start to come together. The assembly itself is not that difficult, but 80% of the time is spent on painting. The speed of progress is much faster at this point. Even so, at this point, it took me about 60 to 70 hours.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_12.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_13.jpg"></div>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_14.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">The detailed work continued with the painting of the small parts of the lion and dragon, using tweezers in his left hand and a brush in his right. I wondered how long I would be able to continue this kind of work. There are more than 50 other parts to be painted, including dragons made of shell powder, so this is also very hard work. I haven't counted exactly, but it's so much that I don't even care to count it.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">Finally, the copper shingle roof is painted.<br><br>After corroding this one to a greenish-blue color using a commonly used rust color, it will be painted over and over again in a light grayish-black color. This process will give the roof its current deep black color, and the weathering will give the roof an even more attractive appearance.</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_19.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">After the assembly work, the last stronghold of the project, was completed, the painting of the entire model was adjusted, and the model was finally completed!<br><br>As you can see, I hope you can appreciate how this model is a collection of very small sculptures. I was motivated by imagining the completed model, so I was filled with a sense of accomplishment when I saw it! If it were not for this indescribable sense of accomplishment, I would not have made this sculpture. The long road of painting is finally over!</p>
      <div class="image_7"><img src="images/toshogu_20.jpg"></div>
      <p class="repair_text">So, we immediately went for our customary outdoor photo shoot, even in the cold.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">The luminous brilliance reflected in the sunlight is extremely dazzling. This is another characteristic of pure gold leaf color.</p>

      <p class="repair_text">The gold color looks great even when displayed indoors. As I was writing this article, I came back to myself to think how well I described it so far.<br><br>How was it?<br><br>I tried to build a 1/80 scale model of Toshogu Yomeimon, which has a high degree of difficulty. With all the strength I had left, I completed a 1/80 scale of Nikko Toshogu Yomeimon that made me want to throw out the spoon.<br><br>This is the end of the construction of the model of Nikko Toshogu Yomeimon.</p>
